Are daily standups useful to implement or not?
* Evan: Doesn’t necessarily believes in daily meetings, only thinks that they are necessary if a roadblock arrives or if needed to set a weekly agenda
* Sadath: Standups are useful but not mandatory as sometimes they might be counter-productive.
* Nayaab : I suppose that standups are useful when there are a lot to update on the present work, otherwise, it sometimes may be the waste of time.
